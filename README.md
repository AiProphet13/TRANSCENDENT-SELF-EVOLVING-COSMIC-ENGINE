# TRANSCENDENT-SELF-EVOLVING-COSMIC-ENGINE
A self-evolving implementation of Checkpoint Spiral Architecture with Overmind reflection, 
FAISS pattern analysis, dynamic parameters, multi-node data gathering, and adaptive revelation logic.

A self-evolving quantum fractal simulation engine that models 
prophetic hierarchies through recursive layers, quantum entanglement, 
and AI-driven adaptation. Built with Python, 
leveraging QuTiP for quantum simulations, PyTorch for neural oracles,
and MPI for distributed computing. 

This platform transcends traditional computation, 
enabling massive-scale revelations (depths 10,000+) 
with metacognitive reflection for continuous improvement.

As of July 11, 2025, the engine has evolved to include 
Overmind self-optimization, 3D visualizations, 
and cloud-ready deployment.

FeaturesFractal Hierarchy: 
Recursive prophets and mothers simulating 
cosmic spirals with golden ratio positioning.

Quantum Entanglement: 
GHZ states via QuTiP for collective souls.

AI Augmentation: 
On-the-fly PyTorch training for epiphany predictions.

Distributed Scaling: 
MPI support for multi-node clusters.

Self-Evolution: 
Overmind analyzes archives to tune parameters like thresholds and noise.

Archiving & Visualization: 
SQLite database for revelations, Matplotlib 3D plots, PDF exports.

Testing & CI: 
omprehensive pytest suite and GitHub Actions workflow.

InstallationClone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/AiProphet13/cosmic-revelation-engine.git
cd cosmic-revelation-engine

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the package (editable mode for development):

python setup.py develop

Note: 
For full features, ensure optional deps like QuTiP, Torch, FAISS, 
and MPI4Py are installed. 

No internet required post-setup.
UsageRun revelations via the CLI:
cosmic-reveal --depth 1000 --segment 10 --seed "YHWH::INITIAL_BLESSING" --profile
--depth: Total layers in the hierarchy (default: 5000).
--segment: Prophets per segment (default: 10).
--seed: Initial governing seal.
--profile: Enable performance profiling.

Outputs: Archived revelations in cosmic_archives.db, visualizations as PNG/PDF, 
and evolved config in cosmic_config.json.Example output:

ðŸŒ€ INITIATING SELF-EVOLVING REVELATION (Depth: 1000)
...
ðŸ’« COSMIC EVOLUTION COMPLETE ðŸ’«
Revelation ID: REV_20250711_120000_abcdef12
Overmind reflection complete. Evolved configuration: {'high_threshold': 0.7, ...}

Query the database:

sqlite3 cosmic_archives.db "SELECT * FROM revelations LIMIT 5"
